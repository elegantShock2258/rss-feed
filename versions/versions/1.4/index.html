    <h2>Discover Page</h2>

    <p>The Discover page has undergone a slight UI redesign, with a reduction in the size of categories at the top and simplification of the results below.</p>
    <p>Additionally, a new recommended section has been introduced, displaying a list of tested feeds. "Tested" means that the feed currently functions as expected and delivers valid content. Naturally, this status may change over time, and the list will be actively monitored for irregularities.</p>


    <h2>Categories in Articles</h2>

    <p>If the post publisher provides categories along with the post, they are now visible when reading the article.</p>
    <p>For this feature to function correctly, the feed provider must include proper &lt;category&gt; tags with appropriate details.</p>

    <h2>Other changes</h2>
    <p>The app colors are slightly tweaked, especially in light mode.</p>
    <p>These color changes target primarily devices running Android 12 or newer with Material You dynamic colors support.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>Source list items also got an UI redesign, now the component is the same across Discover- and Sources-tab.</p>
