    <p>The Discover page has undergone a slight UI redesign, with a reduction in the size of categories at the top and simplification of the results below.</p>
    <p>Additionally, a new recommended section has been introduced, displaying a list of tested feeds. "Tested" denotes that the feed currently functions as expected and delivrs valid content. Naturally, this status may change over time, and the list will be actively monitored for irregularities.</p>


    <h2>Categories in Articles</h2>

    <p>If the post publisher provides categories along with the post, they are now visible when reading the article.</p>
    <p>For this feature to function correctly, the feed provider must include proper &lt;category&gt; tags with appropriate categories.</p>
